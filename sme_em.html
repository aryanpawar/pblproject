		<h2>Other Information :</h2>
		<p>
			The subjects which further come in your engineering will be based on this subject like Strength of Materials, Mechanics Of Material, etc. This subjects gives you the basics for everything which are required further. So it is better to learn the concepts and everything in an sorted manner rather than studying just to pass the exam.
